# [autosampler](https://taperinstruments.github.io/autosampler/)

A port of [Yann Seznec](https://github.com/yannseznec)'s [auto_sampler](https://github.com/yannseznec/auto_sampler) for the Web.

Once SAMPLING is switched on, every two seconds, audio is sampled into a random sample bank, then looped. Each sample bank is randomly assigned a playback speed (0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2), and play direction (forwards or backwards). DURATION controls the length of each sample in seconds. ACTIVE controls the number of sample banks that will be sampled and looped.
